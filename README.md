As an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company launching in Chicago, my task is to identify patterns in the available data. The goal is to gain insights into passenger preferences and understand how external factors influence ride frequency.

Through database analysis, I will examine competitor data and test a hypothesis on the impact of weather conditions on ride demand. This project aims to uncover key factors that drive user behavior, providing actionable insights to optimize Zuber's operations and customer experience.
