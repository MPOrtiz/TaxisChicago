## 🚖 TaxisChicago: Ride-Sharing Insights for Zuber

As part of my role as a data analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing startup launching in Chicago, my mission is to explore patterns in taxi ride data to better understand what drives passenger choices and how external factors affect ride frequency. 📊🌆

In this project, I dive into a public database to:

🔍 Analyze data from existing competitors

🌦️ Test a hypothesis on how weather conditions impact ride demand

💡 Uncover key insights about user behavior

The goal? To provide actionable recommendations that will help Zuber make smarter business decisions, optimize operations, and deliver a top-notch experience for future riders. 🚗💨

Let’s turn data into decisions! 🧠📈
